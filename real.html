    <h2 style="text-align: center; ">HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</h2>
    <p style="padding: 0 10px;">HTML, in full hypertext markup language, a formatting system for displaying material retrieved over the Internet. Each retrieval unit is known as a Web page (from World Wide Web), and such pages frequently contain hypertext links that allow related pages to be retrieved. HTML is the markup language for encoding Web pages. It was designed by the British scientist Sir Tim Berners-Lee at the CERN nuclear physics laboratory in Switzerland during the 1980s. HTML markup tags specify document elements such as headings, paragraphs, and tables. They mark up a document for display by a computer program known as a Web browser. The browser interprets the tags, displaying the headings, paragraphs, and tables in a layout that is adapted to the screen size and fonts available to it.

        HTML documents also contain anchors, which are tags that specify links to other Web pages. An anchor has the form <A HREF= “http://www.britannica.com”> Encyclopædia Britannica</A>, where the quoted string is the URL (universal resource locator) to which the link points (the Web “address”) and the text following it is what appears in a Web browser, underlined to show that it is a link to another page. What is displayed as a single page may also be formed from multiple URLs, some containing text and others graphics. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">Learn HTML</a></p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">CASCADING STYLE SHEET</h2>
    <p style="padding: 0 10px;">So what is CSS and what is CSS used for?

        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style” and the latest version is CSS 3.
        
        While Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), Cascading Style Sheet language comes through and specifies your document’s style — page layouts, colors, and fonts (shoutout to font-family and font-style!) are all determined with CSS syntax, meaning that CSS is one important language for you to master in terms of styling your web pages!
        
        Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has one), and Cascading Style Sheets as the aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a mid-century modern home). You need both to create a web page and JavaScript to make it interactive. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">Learn CSS</a></p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">JAVASCRIPT</h2>
    <p style="padding: 0 10px;">Welcome to the fifth and final day of your web development short course! Today, we’ll touch upon JavaScript and try to improvise a bit as we learn more about this third and final pillar of the web.

        JavaScript, as you might know, is ubiquitous in today’s software development world. It is the foundation of frontend web development and is the key ingredient in frameworks like ReactJS, Angular, and VueJS. It can also help create solid backends with platforms like Nodejs, runs desktop applications like Slack, Atom, and Spotify, and runs on mobile phones as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
        
        In short, it is everywhere—and for good reasons. For starters, compared to other languages like C and Java, JavaScript is generally easier to learn. When we say ‘easier’, we mean in terms of how quickly you can go from being a JavaScript novice to someone who can actually make a living writing professional, high quality JavaScript code. So, in that sense, it’s more accessible than some other languages like C and Java.
        
        JavaScript is also a fun and rewarding language, which is especially important when you’re just getting started in software development. The community support is very good, so if you get stuck, there’s a good chance that the problem and its solution already exist on the web. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Learn JAVASCRIPT</a></p>
